# bayesian-election-forecasting
Code from Applied Bayesian Statistics course project

- To build and run the model run baseline.R.
- To generate the result plot in the report run intervals.R afterwards.
- The file poll_data_plots.R generates the data plots in the project report.
- The file no-corr.R contains an alternative version of the model without state correlation.
- The data files were downloaded from https://d2hg8soec8ck9v.cloudfront.net/datasets/us_elections/electoral_college_votes.pickle and https://d2hg8soec8ck9v.cloudfront.net/datasets/us_elections/us_presidential_election_data_historical.pickle and converted to tsv files. 
- The file all_polls.csv was taken from this repo: https://github.com/TheEconomist/us-potus-model.
